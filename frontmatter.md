## Abstract

In this workshop, you will learn the principles of performing tidy text analysis in R. You will learn how to wrangle unstructured text into a tidy data structure, basic data visualizations, and basic sentiment analysis while exploring a fun data set of song lyrics. The main packages used will be tidytext and the tidyverse series of packages. This workshop assumes some familiarity with R, RStudio, and the dplyr R package. If you need to brush up on these skills before the workshop, the [Intro to R and RStudio](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/intro-r) workshop will get you up to speed. This workshop will be held on Zoom.

## Learning objectives

In this workshop, participants will:

-   learn how to turn unstructured text into a data set they can analyze

-   generate data visualizations to encourage novel explorations of their data

-   gain familiarity with the tidytext package, which facilitates text manipulation in R

-   get a chance to dig into a real data set of song lyrics

## Estimated time

1-1.5 hours

## Prerequisites

-   Familiarity with R, RStudio, and the dplyr R package

## Contexts

### Pre-reading suggestions

-   To gain a deeper sense of what tidy data is, I recommend [this 2014 paper by Hadley Wickham](https://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper)

### Projects that use these skills

-   This is a great [live walk-through](https://juliasilge.com/blog/animal-crossing/) of a sentiment analysis of Animal Crossing reviews! It's by the one and only Julia Silge, who authored the tidytext package.

### Ethical considerations

-   Text analysis has applications across a variety of disciplines. Regardless of discipline, the act of quantifying text requires special consideration. Within this workshop, we perform a basic sentiment analysis, where sentiments like positivity or negativity are attributed to words or phrases. These associations are listed in a corpus, which contains the word or phrase and the sentiment it is associated with. All subsequent analyses depend on the associations listed in the corpus the analyst chooses. Therefore, any bias or mistake propagates through the analysis. A particular corpus will not be appropriate for every research question and must be interrogated and discussed in any resulting research product.
