# Introduction to Text Analysis in R

This is a short workshop (1-1.5 hour) that can be taught as a standalone workshop and on the R track for the Digital Research Institute.

## Credits

This workshop was written by [Connor French](https://github.com/connor-french).

## Workshops

It was first taught at CUNY GC by Connor French in the Spring of 2021 as a 1.5 hour online synchronous workshop.

Abstract:

> In this workshop, you will learn the principles of performing tidy text analysis in R. You will learn how to wrangle unstructured text into a tidy data structure, basic data visualizations, and basic sentiment analysis while exploring a fun data set of song lyrics. The main packages used will be tidytext and the tidyverse series of packages. This workshop assumes some familiarity with R, RStudio, and the dplyr R package. If you need to brush up on these skills before the workshop, the [Intro to R and RStudio](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/intro-r) workshop will get you up to speed. This workshop will be held on Zoom.

## Requirements

-   Students need to be familiar with the R and RStudio environments. In addition, they should have a basic understanding of dplyr verbs and pipes (%\>%). The Intro to R and RStudio workshop is a necessary pre-req if they're not otherwise familiar with R and the Data Wrangling in R workshop is helpful.

## Reception and feedback

Feedback was positive. A couple participants wanted a more advanced workshop, so that's something to consider for the future.

## Needed/Desired

Given the short length of the workshop, I made this in a "walk-through" format. If future fellows want to turn it into a longer workshop, incorporating challenges and exercises would be good.

## Instructor notes

The easiest way to run this course is on RStudio Cloud. It makes distributing materials easy and you don't need to troubleshoot installations. The RStudio cloud website ([rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud)) has straightforward instructions for its use.

The song lyrics are just some I got off a whim. I have a pdf in the repo called `get_genius_lyrics.pdf` that you could modify to get a different set of lyrics.

I went through the workshop up until the "Going Further" section, which arrived at about the 1 hour mark. After that, I allowed people who wanted to leave leave and continued the workshop until the end for those who wanted to stay. At both checkpoints I pasted the attendance link and workshop response forms in the chat.
